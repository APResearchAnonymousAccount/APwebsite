Minor problems I try to correct on the spot, but egregious problems I record and report.\n\nGuess what about 90% of the responses are of people I report… Yep, personal attacks on me. I threatened them; I harassed them; I called them names…\n\nThis is exactly the behavior I’m seeing from the people being exposed by Musk’s releases. The evidence is undeniable; it’s their own words, for Pete’s sake! So they’re going after Musk personally.\n\nThe other very common response I see when someone is “busted” is to try to shift blame. Even before Musk took over, media was talking about how Musk would become a threat to free speech, and how that much power could affect elections, sway public opinion. And voila! That is precisely what we now know they were doing.\n\nIf you want to know what deviousness the left is up to, just listen to what they are accusing someone else of doing. It really is that simple.",
